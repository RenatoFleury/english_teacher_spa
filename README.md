# Single Page Aplication for English Teachers

This is a project that I made to help a friend and consists of a static Single Page Application designed to enhance contact sharing and marketing for English teachers. It provides a clean, modern interface to showcase services, engage potential students, and improve online presence. 

## Features

- Vertical and/or horizontal scrolling page sections
- Social media integration
- Responsive layouts (Web and mobile) and multiple themes
- Lightweight data store enables persistence
